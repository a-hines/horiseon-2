# horiseon

This is my first challenge project for coding bootcamp. In this project I was asked to clone a starter code and refractor the code to aid accesibility as a means to showcase what I have learned so far in html and CSS styling. 

In the process of refactoring, I added alt tags to all images on the page. Purely decorative images were given blank alt tags. I also condensed the style guide so that it was not repetative and added notes to both the code and the style guide. Lastly, I ensured that the navigation links took the user to the appropirate portion of the page. 

Changes were pushed to github although maybe not as frequently as they should have been.
