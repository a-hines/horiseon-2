# Project Title

Horiseon is my first challenge project for coding bootcamp. In this project I was asked to clone a starter code and refractor the code to aid accesibility as a means to showcase what I have learned so far in html and css styling. 

# Motivaion
The motivation behind this work was to meet all of the aceptance criteria for the assignment while implementing my (so far) very limited knowledge of html and css.

To meet the acceptance criteria, I added alt tags to all images on the page. Purely decorative images were given blank alt tags. I also condensed the style guide so that it was not repetative and added notes to both the code and the style guide. Lastly, I ensured that the navigation links took the user to the appropirate portion of the page. 

Changes were pushed to github although maybe not as frequently as they should have been.
